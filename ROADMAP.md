## Vision & Principles

### 🧩 Modularity & Isolation
AstrOS avoids monolithic coupling. AI modules, UI enhancements, and system integrations are separate, controllable, and upgradeable components.

### 🔗 Compatibility & Leverage
Built upon Ubuntu LTS to reuse its stable ecosystem (drivers, packages, security updates) without reinventing core OS components.

### 🔄 Reproducibility & Infrastructure as Code
All ISO builds, overlays, and configurations are version-controlled with reproducible builds.

### 🌐 Transparency & Community Governance
Open decisions, roadmaps, and architecture changes through public discussions and PR reviews.

### 📈 Incremental & Iterative Growth
Launch with minimal viable AI features, then iterate and scale based on feedback.

### 🔒 Security & Maintainability
Strict code review, dependency audits, security policies, and comprehensive documentation.

## Architecture Overview

```
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│     User-facing UI / Agents    │ ← UI integrations, agent assistants
├───────────────────────────────┤
│     AI / Inference Layer       │ ← Model runtime, pipelines, context
├───────────────────────────────┤
│     Integration / Glue Layer   │ ← Connectors, APIs, orchestrators
├───────────────────────────────┤
│     Ubuntu Base Layer          │ ← Kernel, drivers, system services
└───────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer is implemented as modular Debian packages with clear interfaces, ensuring maintainability and extensibility.
