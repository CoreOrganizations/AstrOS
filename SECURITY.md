## 🔐 Security Measures

### Core Security Principles

1. **🔒 Privacy by Design**: User data stays local unless explicitly shared
2. **🛡️ Least Privilege**: Components run with minimal required permissions
3. **🔍 Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
4. **🚪 Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration out of the box
5. **📊 Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security events

### Technical Security Features

#### AI Module Security
- **API Key Security**: Secure handling of OpenAI/OpenRouter API keys
- **Sandboxing**: AI components run in isolated environments
- **Permission Model**: Granular permissions for system access
- **Input Filtering**: Malicious prompt detection and filtering
- **Output Validation**: AI responses are validated before execution
- **Local-First**: Privacy-preserving local AI processing by default
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against API abuse

#### System Integration Security
- **Code Signing**: All packages and updates are cryptographically signed
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans of dependencies
- **Secure Boot**: Support for UEFI Secure Boot
- **Encrypted Storage**: Full disk encryption available by default

#### Network Security
- **TLS Everywhere**: All network communications use TLS 1.3+
- **Certificate Pinning**: Critical connections use certificate pinning
- **Local-First**: Minimize external network dependencies
- **Firewall Integration**: Built-in firewall configuration

### Development Security

#### Secure Development Practices
- **Security Reviews**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular security updates for dependencies
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets in source code

#### Supply Chain Security
- **Reproducible Builds**: All builds are reproducible and verifiable
- **Signed Commits**: Contributors use GPG-signed commits
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials for all releases
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans of the entire supply chain

### 🛠️ Security Best Practices for Users

### For End Users
1. **Keep Updated**: Install security updates promptly
2. **Secure API Keys**: Use environment variables, never commit keys to code
3. **Review Permissions**: Regularly audit AI component permissions
4. **Monitor API Usage**: Check OpenAI/OpenRouter dashboards for unusual activity
5. **Use Strong Authentication**: Enable strong passwords and 2FA where available
6. **Local Mode**: Consider using local-only mode for sensitive operations
7. **Backup Data**: Maintain secure backups of important data

### For API Key Management
1. **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables only
2. **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys
3. **Usage Monitoring**: Set billing alerts on your AI provider accounts
4. **Least Privilege**: Use API keys with minimal required permissions
5. **Secure Storage**: Never store API keys in configuration files or code

### For Developers
1. **Follow Secure Coding**: Use our security guidelines
2. **Validate Inputs**: Always sanitize and validate user inputs
3. **Handle Secrets**: Never commit secrets to version control
4. **Update Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date
5. **Test Security**: Include security testing in your workflow

### For Plugin Developers
1. **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions
2. **Secure Storage**: Use secure storage APIs for sensitive data
3. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors
4. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit your plugin for vulnerabilities
5. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities in other plugins
