# Security Policy üõ°Ô∏è

AstrOS takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policies, reporting procedures, and commitment to protecting users and the community.

---

## üéØ Security Principles

### Zero-Trust Security Model

AstrOS implements a zero-trust security architecture:

- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Least Privilege Access**: Users and plugins get minimal required permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against threats
- **Privacy by Design**: User data protection is built into every component
- **Transparent Security**: Open source allows security auditing

### Security-First Development

- **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
- **Fail Securely**: System failures don't compromise security
- **Regular Security Reviews**: Code and architecture security assessments
- **Automated Security Testing**: Continuous security validation
- **Security Training**: Team education on secure development practices

---

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We strongly encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities to protect AstrOS users.

#### üîí For Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

**Instead, report privately:**

- **User Consent**: Users approve plugin permissions
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuous permission compliance checking
- **Audit Logging**: All plugin actions are logged

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and rotation
- **End-to-End Encryption**: For sensitive user communications

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Development Practices

### Secure Coding Standards

#### Input Validation
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Validate and sanitize all inputs
def process_file_path(user_path: str) -> str:
    # Validate path format
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9/._-]+$', user_path):
        raise ValueError("Invalid path format")
    
    # Resolve and validate path
    resolved_path = Path(user_path).resolve()
    allowed_base = Path("/home/user").resolve()
    
    if not str(resolved_path).startswith(str(allowed_base)):
        raise PermissionError("Path outside allowed directory")
    
    return str(resolved_path)

# ‚ùå Bad: Direct use of user input
def unsafe_file_operation(user_path: str):
    with open(user_path, 'w') as f:  # Directory traversal risk
        f.write(data)
```

#### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use parameterized queries
async def get_user_data(user_id: str) -> Dict:
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
    return await db.fetch_one(query, user_id)

# ‚ùå Bad: String concatenation
async def unsafe_query(user_id: str):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '{user_id}'"  # SQL injection risk
    return await db.fetch_one(query)
```

#### Secret Management
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use environment variables or secure stores
import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("API key not configured")

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded secrets
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Never do this!
```

### Security Testing

#### Automated Security Scanning
```bash
# Static analysis
bandit -r src/ -f json -o security-report.json

# Dependency scanning
safety check --json

# Secret scanning
truffleHog --regex --entropy=False .

# SAST scanning
semgrep --config=auto src/
```

#### Penetration Testing
- **Regular Security Audits**: Quarterly security assessments
- **External Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party testing
- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Continuous security monitoring
- **Code Review Security Focus**: Security-focused code reviews

## üìä Security Monitoring

### Logging and Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging
```python
# Security event logging
import structlog

security_logger = structlog.get_logger("security")

def log_security_event(event_type: str, **kwargs):
    security_logger.warning(
        "Security event detected",
        event_type=event_type,
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        **kwargs
    )

# Usage examples
log_security_event("failed_login", user_id="user123", ip="192.168.1.1")
log_security_event("permission_denied", user_id="user456", resource="admin_panel")
```

#### Anomaly Detection
- **Failed Authentication Monitoring**: Detect brute force attempts
- **Unusual API Usage**: Monitor for suspicious patterns
- **Resource Usage Anomalies**: Detect potential attacks
- **Plugin Behavior Monitoring**: Watch for malicious plugin activity

### Incident Response

#### Security Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Improve security measures
