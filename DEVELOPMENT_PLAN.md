### üöÄ **Getting Started with Phase 2**

1. **Immediate Next Steps:**
   ```bash
   # Research local LLM options
   pip install transformers torch
   
   # Set up development environment
   python -m venv venv_dev
   source venv_dev/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   venv_dev\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   
   # Install development dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. **First Development Task:**
   - Create `src/astros/llm/` directory
   - Implement local model loader
   - Add configuration for model selection
   - Test with small models (GPT-2, DistilBERT)

3. **Development Guidelines:**
   - All new features must have tests
