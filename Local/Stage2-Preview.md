# Stage 2: AI Integration - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Stage 2 focuses on adding real AI capabilities to AstrOS, transforming it from a basic command processor to an intelligent agent that can understand natural language and provide smart responses.

## Week 5-6: Natural Language Processing

### Goals
- Add NLP capabilities for better command understanding
- Implement intent classification
- Add basic conversation context

### Implementation Steps

#### Day 1-3: Add NLP Dependencies
```bash
# Install additional AI packages
pip install transformers torch spacy nltk sentence-transformers
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### Day 4-7: Create NLP Module
- Create `src/astros/ai/nlp.py`
- Implement text preprocessing
- Add named entity recognition
- Create intent classification system

#### Day 8-10: Integrate with Agent
- Update agent to use NLP processing
- Add conversation context management
- Implement smarter response generation

## Week 7-8: Plugin System Foundation

### Goals
- Create extensible plugin architecture
- Implement first core plugins
- Add plugin management system

### Core Plugins to Implement
1. **File Management Plugin**: Basic file operations
2. **System Control Plugin**: System commands and info
3. **Calculator Plugin**: Mathematical operations
4. **Weather Plugin**: Basic weather information

## Stage 2 Success Criteria
- ✅ Agent understands natural language commands
- ✅ Plugin system loads and executes plugins
- ✅ Context awareness between commands
- ✅ Smart response generation
- ✅ Extensible architecture for future plugins

## Quick Start for Stage 2

Run this command to begin Stage 2:
```bash
python -m astros.cli interactive
```

Then test these natural language commands:
- "Can you help me organize my files?"
- "What's the weather like today?"
- "Calculate 15 * 24 + 37"
- "Show me system information"
- "Create a new folder called 'AstrOS-Projects'"
